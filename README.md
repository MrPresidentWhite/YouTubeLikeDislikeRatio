# YouTubeLikeDislikeRatio

## About the Script

This is a Tampermonkey Script which will help yout to see the like/dislike ratio in percent from a YouTube Video. This Plugin is based on the [Return YouTube Dislike](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/). This Script will also work without the browser extension but you will have the best experience if you install the `Return YouTube Dislikes` browser extension.

## How to use this script?

- Install the Tampermonkey browser extension for your desired browser if available
- Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser bar
- Click on `Create new User Script`, paste the raw source code from the `YouTubeLikeDislikeRatio.js` file in this repo and save the file
- Reload or visit a new YouTube video and then yo should see on your like/dislike counter something like this:
